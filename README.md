## About The Project

<img>

I made this project to solve a problem that I myself was having. Searching for good quality books always seemed more difficult than it really should be. The experience of finding books online usually ended up in two different places, that being either finding long lists of the "greatest books ever" where one list was indistinguishable from another or looking through lists of books that have recently come out and feeling a strong sense of recency bias.

This app seeks to fix the issues i was having by tailoring what the user is looking for using their prompts and offering book suggestions based off of their tastes. It also serves as a hub where the user can store all the books that they are interested in reading, while containing relevant links and resources to look at reviews/purchase their books. Doing all this while using an intuitive interface similar to that of dating apps like Tinder.
